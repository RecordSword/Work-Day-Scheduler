An application that generates a Schedule based on a third part API known as Moment JS. This uses a third party code in order to generate the current time and date so we can utilise this information for our schedule. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS to show what time of day it is and the date.

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
You'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.
